Dear _____,

As you were previously notified in the attached notification, the agreement between USAble Life and BCBSMN for the joint sales and distribution of USAble Life’s commercial life insurance expired on June 30, 2015.  

During this transition, it has come to our attention that you are not appointed with USAble Life.   I’ve attached the appointment requisition form, W-9 and the Direct Deposit authorization form that must be completed and submitted to licensing@usablelife.com.
