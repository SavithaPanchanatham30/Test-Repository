Good ______________,

Thank you for returning your signed contract.  However there were a couple of agreements that were not included in your original package.  Please see the attached HIPPA and Non-Disclosure Agreements that need to be signed, dated and returned to USAble Life.  Please keep a copy for your record.  Once received, we will add them to your contract.

Thanks,
Jeannie
