Thank you for your inquiry regarding your commission payment from USAble Life.

There was a delay in getting the commission payment deposit processed with the bank. Our EFTs are now set up to push multiple times during the day so you may receive your deposit by the end of the day today depending on requirements of your personal bank.

We apologize for any inconvenience!

Thank you,
