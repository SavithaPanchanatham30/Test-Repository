Enclosed is the fully-executed Agency Agreement for [Insert New Name].  This agreement supersedes and replaces our prior agreement with [Insert Old Name].  

Accordingly, we plan to terminate our agency agreement with [Insert Old Name], effective [Insert Dateâ€”Date of e-mail plus 10 business days].  Unless you notify us of some reason not to do so, termination will be effective [Insert Date].

Thank you,
Amy
