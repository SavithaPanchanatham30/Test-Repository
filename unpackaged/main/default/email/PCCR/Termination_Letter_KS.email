To Whom It May Concern,

Our records indicate your agency has not written any new business within the last 12 months and/or does not currently have a minimum of $250K total in force.  Because your agency does not meet the minimum requirements for USAble Life to continue paying the appointment fee, your agencyâ€™s appointment to sell, solicit or negotiate Life, Accident and Health insurance on behalf of USAble Life in the State of Kansas has been terminated effective May 24, 2018.  Any vested commissions that you may have will continue to be paid.

Additionally, because the State of Kansas is an affiliation state, this appointment termination applies to all affiliated agents.  Attached is a list of the agents to whom this termination applies.

Should you have questions concerning this letter, please contact licensing@usablelife.com to discuss the reinstatement process and any applicable fees.

Thank you,
Licensing
