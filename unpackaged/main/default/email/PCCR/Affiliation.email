To Whom it May Concern:

The State of __ requires that you be affiliated with your agency.  Any individual licensee who represents an agency or acts on  its behalf, must have their individual license associated to the agency's license by means of an affiliation.  It is the agency's responsibility to contact the state's Department of Insurance to request the affiliation.

Please let us know when your agency has completed the affiliation and we will be able to process your appointment with USAble Life.

If you have questions, please let us know.

Thank you.
