Dear _____,

If the Agent of Record is a business entity receiving commissions and the business entity is purchased or merged into another business entity, a copy of the purchase or merger agreement is required to change over all existing business to the new entity.  The agreement must be signed by both the seller and the buyer.  

If the purchase agreement cannot be provided, a letter signed by the President of the selling and buying companies that legally explains the transaction can be accepted in lieu of the complete agreement.   

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you,
Licensing
