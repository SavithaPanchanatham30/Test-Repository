Hello [Producer Agency/Independent Agent/Sub-Agent],

We are contacting you to begin the onboarding and appointment process because you have either sold a new case or have an existing LifeMap group scheduled to be migrated to USAble Life.

Attached is our appointment packet for your completion. Please return the following:

Completed USAble Life Agent/Agency Appointment Request Form
Copy of you or your agencyâ€™s Errors & Omissions (E&O) certificate of coverage
Completed USAble Life Commission Direct Deposit Authorization, along with a copy of a voided check
Completed W-9

To minimize delays with your appointment and any related compensation, please reply to this email, attaching the completed required paperwork so that we may proceed with the onboarding and appointment process.

Once the appointment has been processed, if you are an independent agent or your agency is not already contracted with USAble Life, you will receive an email from the PCCR Agent Contracting and Compliance Specialist, providing a USAble Life agreement to be executed by both parties.

Please reach out to me with any questions.

Thank you again for being a valued partner, and we look forward to working with you.
