Dear _____, 

We have received your request for USAble Life website access.  The USAble Life website allows producers with group business to be able to view their groups online.  Since our records indicate you do not have any group business with USAble Life, we are unable to set you up for website access.  Once you have sold group business with USAble Life, we will notify you that you are now eligible to sign up for access to view your groups.

If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thank you.
