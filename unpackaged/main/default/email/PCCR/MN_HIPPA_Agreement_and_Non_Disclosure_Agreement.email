Dear _____,

Thank you for returning your signed contract.  However, there were a couple of agreements that were not included in your original package.  Please see the attached HIPAA Business Associate Agreement and Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement that need to be signed, dated and returned to USAble Life.  Once these documents are counter-signed by our office, we will send a final signed copy for your records.

Thank you,
Licensing
