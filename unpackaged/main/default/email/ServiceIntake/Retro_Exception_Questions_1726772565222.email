<br />
Thank you for allowing us to assist you.&nbsp;<br />

<span style="color:black">To retroactively enroll voluntary coverages from member's effective date, [insert effective date], we would need to verify the following information below and, if needed, will be sent to our Retro Committee for review.</span></span></span>
<ul>
	<li style="vertical-align: middle; color: black;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight:normal"><span style="font-style:normal">Please verify that this member is actively at work and has no pending or expected claims.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li style="vertical-align: middle; color: black;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Has the member been payroll deducting&nbsp;for&nbsp;[insert type of voluntary benefits]? If so, we will need&nbsp;documentation of payroll deductions back to the earliest deduction taken.</span></span></li>
	<li style="vertical-align: middle; color: black;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">If the member hasn't been deducting&nbsp;premiums for this benefit, then does the group agree&nbsp;to remit all premium deducted from the employee’s payroll from the employee’s original effective date forward?</span></span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">If you need any further assistance, you may also contact our Customer Care center at (800) 370-5856 Monday through Friday 8:00am - 5:00pm CST.</span></span></body>
