<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="line-height:107%"><span style="line-height:107%">Attached is the Vendor Guide Book to review and assist in your file build. This vendor book includes the benefit and account structure, data requirements, file delivery rules, open enrollment guidelines, and more.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="line-height:107%">USAble Life has assigned this implementation&nbsp;case to <u>XXX</u>, one of our EDI Benefit Data Analysts who will oversee the Testing process with you.<br />
<br />
Once the file build is complete, please respond to this email&nbsp;(</span><a href="mailto:EDIRequest@usablelife.com" style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline"><span style="line-height:107%">EDIRequest@usablelife.com</span></a><span style="line-height:107%">) and let USAble Life know that the file has been delivered. </span></span><br />
<span style="line-height:107%">The reference code included in the subject line must be included on all responses. If this is removed on any responses, it can result in delays due to potentially being distributed to another team member and opening a new EDI service ticket.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="line-height:107%">Once the first test file has been received, we will potentially ask all parties to schedule for an onboarding call to resolve any issues we are seeing in the file data, but may be able to provide feedback and make corrections over email alone if the issues are not severe. <span style="color:black">Once your vendor delivers the initial test file to Usable Life, the testing process will begin.&nbsp;USAble Lifeâ€™s goal is to complete all testing within forty-five (45) days from receiving the initial test file.<br />
<br />
During the implementation process you will be required to continue to perform all regular member maintenance until USAble Life notifies you that the implementation phase has ended and has been approved for production. Member maintenance can be accomplished two ways: USAble Life's online portal,&nbsp;<b><a href="https://accessable.usablelife.com/#/" style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline">AccessAble</a>&nbsp;</b>OR&nbsp;via email submission to <a href="mailto:EDIRequest@USAbleLife.com" style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline">EDIRequest@USAbleLife.com</a> </span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="line-height:107%"><span style="color:black">Throughout the EDI testing process, members and/or benefits may be updated by a USAble Life Benefits Data Analyst in the production environment as discrepancies are identified and corrected in the data. This can result in billing adjustments showing on the bills during the testing process until the first bill generated after the EDI file has moved to production.&nbsp;</span></span><br />
<span style="line-height:107%">&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color:black">Please let us know if there are additional questions or if you would like to schedule a call to talk through the process.</span></span></span></span><br style="font-variant-ligatures:normal; text-align:start; text-decoration-thickness:initial; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial" />
