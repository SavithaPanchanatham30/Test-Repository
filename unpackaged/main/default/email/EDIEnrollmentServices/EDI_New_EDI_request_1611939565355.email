	<li><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">USAble Life is reviewing that your group meets the requirements to include the supplemental benefits in your requested EDI file feed. We have requested a Client Services Manager to assist and ensure your supplemental benefits meet the eligibility requirements to be included in feed. They will review the benefits and be in contact with you if changes are needed.</span></span>

	<ul>
		<li><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Supplemental benefits include the following: <strong>Accident Recovery, Critical Care, Hospital Care</strong></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<br />
<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Once this has been completed, we can continue with the implementation process and provide a vendor guidebook to assist in the benefits/data build.<br />
The implementation process usually requires approximately&nbsp;a 45-day time frame for completion.&nbsp;​​​​​That time frame begins when USAble Life receives the first test file from the vendor. We will potentially request an onboarding call with all parties to review the first test file after it has been reviewed by USAble.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Prior to and throughout testing all regular member maintenance should continue to be processed or submitted until USAble Life notifies you that the EDI implementation phase has ended and has been approved for&nbsp;production.&nbsp;Throughout the EDI testing process, members and/or benefits may be updated in the production environment as discrepancies are identified and corrected in the data. This can result in billing adjustments showing on the bills during the testing process and up to the first bill generated after the EDI file has moved to production.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Please let us know if there are additional questions, or if you would like to schedule a call to talk through the process.</span></span></body>
