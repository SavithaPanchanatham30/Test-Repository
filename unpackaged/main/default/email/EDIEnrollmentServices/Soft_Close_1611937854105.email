<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="line-height:107%">USAble Life has previously reached out regarding the status of the Test file for the EDI implementation. We understand that sometimes it takes longer than planned to make the necessary preparations. However, due to the amount of time that has passed without&nbsp;feedback, USAble Life will no longer be tracking this EDI implementation. Please take the necessary time to complete your preparations for the file and submit a Test file when you are ready.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="line-height:107%"><u>This is not a closure or denial of your request for an EDI feed to be established.</u></span><br />
<br />
<span style="line-height:107%">Once a test file is submitted, please <b>respond to this email</b> and we will pick up where we left off. Please remember, during this testing period member maintenance can be accomplished two ways:<br />
<br />
USAble Life's online portal, <b><a href="https://accessable.usablelife.com/#/" style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline">AccessAble</a>&nbsp;</b>OR&nbsp;email submission to <a href="mailto:Maintenance@USAbleLife.com" style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline">Membership@USAbleLife.com</a></span><br />
<br />
<span style="line-height:107%">If you do not wish to move forward with the EDI implementation, we ask that you please notify us and we will close the request.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="line-height:107%">Thank you</span></span></span></p>
