<div class="WordSection1"><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">We have received your request for an EDI feed for your USAble Life products.<br />
The eligibility requirements for a USAble Life EDI file feed include a minimum of 100 active lives or $50,000 annual premium for a group.&nbsp;Unfortunately this group does not meet this criteria so we are unable to move forward.<br />
<br />
<span style="page:WordSection1"><span style="line-height:normal">While this group does not qualify for an EDI automation file, the group or vendor can submit an electronic file on a regular basis (weekly or monthly) to capture changes for that time period. The file should be changes only, not a complete census. The change only file should capture new hires, salary changes, benefit changes, and terminations. This can be submitted in a CSV or XLS formatted report to our membership team to process via&nbsp;<a href="mailto:Maintenance@USAblelife.com"><span style="color:blue">Maintenance@USAblelife.com</span></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;This will require no testing or setup process. However files must be emailed in a secure format, SFTP file delivery is not available.</span><br />
