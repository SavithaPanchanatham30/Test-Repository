<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">This group is going to be brand new to USAble Life as of xx/xx/xxxx,&nbsp; they are still in that process on system setup and on boarding. We will be able to start any EDI implementation once that has been completed and all employees/benefits have been added to our system.<br />
<br />
We anticipate that being closer to the xx/xx/xxxx commencement date, if the setup is done early and we can begin we will be in touch.</body>
