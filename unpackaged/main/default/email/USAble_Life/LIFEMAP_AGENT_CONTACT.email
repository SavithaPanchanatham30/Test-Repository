Hi    

Our records show that you signed the master application for the group listed above.   We need to get you appointed with USAble life in order to get you set up on the group.   Please complete the attached documents and return them to me by replying to this email.   This will help to ensure they are kept within this case.  I will also need you to attach a copy of your agency's current E & O coverage.

Should you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me.

Thanks
Lisa
