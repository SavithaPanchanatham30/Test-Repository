<br />
Hello <span style="background:yellow"><span style="color:black">Submitter</span></span>,<br />
<br />
Thank you for being a valued LifeMap partner. As of January 2022, LifeMap was acquired by Life &amp; Specialty Ventures LLC (LSV), the parent company of USAble Life. USAble Life is a leading provider of voluntary and employer-sponsored supplemental, life, and disability coverage and brings new and innovative products, excellent customer service, and improved technology to the market.<br />
<br />
USAble Life has begun transitioning many operations and functions from LifeMap to USAble Life, including transitioning LifeMap life and disability policies to USAble Life policies upon the groups' anniversary dates. The USAble Life team has identified <span style="background:yellow"><span style="color:black">GROUP NAME</span></span> in your block of business, and we're eager to work with you to make this a smooth process.<br />
<br />
Your group will receive a Notice of Non-Renewal of LifeMap coverage and transition to USAble Life. All LifeMap policies will be terminated effective 9/1/2023. In accordance with the terms of the policies, LifeMap will honor all valid claims that arise prior to the termination date, provided the applicable premium is received.<br />
<br />
Along with this transition come great advantages, and we are requesting your assistance in presenting these advantages to your client. Below and attached are some tools to help communicate these changes to your client and a comprehensive list of what we need to move forward.<br />
<br />
<b>Paperwork Needed to Transition Groups</b><br />
To ensure your group experiences a smooth transition, we will need the below information completed and returned to us by 8/1/2023. Please "Reply All" to this email and attach the following:<br />

<br />
<b>Group Documentation </b><br />
To help answer any questions and help you in conversations with your group(s), we have provided the following documents:<br />
&nbsp;</span></span>

<ul>
	<li style="margin-left:16px"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="tab-stops:list .5in"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">USAble Life Benefit Summary</span></span></span></li>
	<li style="margin-left:16px"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="tab-stops:list .5in"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">Contract Differences Sheet</span></span></span></li>

</ul>
<br />
<span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">The best way to communicate throughout this process is to "Reply All" to this email and attach any completed documents as they come in from the group.<br />
<br />
To make the appointment process as easy as possible with USAble Life, the Licensing &amp; Appointment team will be reaching out to you directly to begin the process to get you and/or your agency contracted and appointed with USAble Life. As a reminder, the agent being appointed with us will need to be the one to sign the attached Group Master Application.<br />
<br />
Please note that if you do not sign the Group Master Application or return the required Appointment &amp; Licensing documents, commissions cannot be set up or paid. Appointment &amp; Licensing documents must be completed, and the Group Master Application must be signed for commissions to be paid.<br />
<br />
<b>Renewal Rates</b><br />
We're pleased to announce that your group is receiving a rate hold with this transition. A renewal will not be provided this year. The current in-force LifeMap rates will be held until the renewal month in 2025. If you have any questions, let me know.<br />
<br />
As always, USAble Life teammates and I are available to answer any questions and participate in conversations with your group(s). Don't hesitate to let me know how we can support you during this transition.<br />
<br />
Thank you again for being a valued partner,<br />
