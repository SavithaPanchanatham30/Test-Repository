<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">Dear _____,<br />
<br />
In order for USAble Life to comply with Internal Revenue Service Regulations, we are asking that you please complete the attached W-9 Form. This request is being made in order that USAble Life can maintain its vendor file with current information and be in compliance with IRS regulations.<br />
<br />
Please make sure that the W-9 Form is completed and correct before submission.
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br />
INDIVIDUAL “TIN”: Only the individual’s name to which the Social Security Number (SSN) was assigned should be entered on the first line (last name, first name &amp; middle initial).</div>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br />
BUSINESS VENDOR “TIN”: The name of a partnership, corporation, sole proprietorship or other entity, must be entered on the first line exactly as it was registered with the IRS when the Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN) was assigned.</div>
<br />
For example, if your commissions are to be paid to you under your SSN, please fill out the portion of the W-9 with your name and corresponding SSN. If the commissions are being paid to a business entity/agency, then the name of the entity/agency should be filled out with the corresponding FEIN.<br />
<br />
In addition, please complete the attached Commission Direct Deposit Authorization form and return all documents to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:licensing@usablelife.com">licensing@usablelife.com</a>. Failure to provide these documents will result in delayed payment.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your cooperation,<br />
<br />
Licensing<br />
