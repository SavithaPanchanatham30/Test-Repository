<br />
We are following up on the previous email sent about appointment with USAble Life (see below).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
You must be appointed with USAble Life before we can set you up in our system for commission payments.&nbsp;Therefore, we must have your appointment forms completed and returned or no payments will be issued. The appointment packet documents are being attached again for your convenience.<br />
<br />
If you have any questions, please let us know.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
