<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">Enclosed is the fully-executed Agency Agreement for [Insert New Name]. This agreement supersedes and replaces our prior agreement with [Insert Old Name].<br />
<br />
Accordingly, we plan to terminate our agency agreement with [Insert Old Name], effective [Insert Dateâ€”Date of e-mail plus 10 business days]. Unless you notify us of some reason not to do so, termination will be effective [Insert Date].<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
Amy<br />
