<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">Dear _____<br />
<br />
We follow a "Just in Time" appointment policy in most states, meaning we do not process appointment requests until an&nbsp; Agent of Record (AOR) change or new business submission is received.<br />
<br />
If you have new business to submit, please send the application to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:newbusiness@usablelife.com">newbusiness@usablelife.com</a>&nbsp;and provide the group name. For AOR changes, please send the details to <a href="AOR_Processing@usablelife.com">AOR_Processing@usablelife.com</a>. Otherwise, we will initiate the appointment process once the business or AOR change is submitted.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your cooperation,<br />
<br />
Licensing</body>
