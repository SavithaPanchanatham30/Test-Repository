<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;"><b>Hello,</b><br />
<br />
<b>As the newly designated Benefits and/or Billing contact for&nbsp;[GROUP NAME HERE],&nbsp;USAble Life would like to extend our welcome to you!</b><br />
<br />
<br />
Your group's enrollment and billing are managed by the administrators of your group. Should you have any questions along the way about this responsibility (maintaining records, submitting premium payments, etc.) please let us know. We are happy to help and support you as needed.<br />
<br />
For your convenience, the Self-Administered Group Administrator Guide attached to this email will provide you with easy reference in administering the group benefits with USAble Life.<br />
<br />
Please visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.usablelife.com/documents/">https://www.usablelife.com/documents/</a>&nbsp;to find helpful administration tools and documents referenced in this guide. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
If you have not already registered for an account on AccessAble, you may do so by requesting your credentials at&nbsp;https://accessable.usablelife.com/#/register&nbsp; and completing the online form. &nbsp;USAble Life will follow up with you if additional information is needed and once the request is approved.&nbsp; As a self-administered group, enrollment records and invoices will not be maintained on AccessAble, however there are several other important features of value to you - group plan information, policy documents, payment history, claim status views, and more!<br />
<br />
If you have any questions or would like to schedule a demonstration please contact us at (800) 370-5856 or custserve@usablelife.com.<br />

<b>Thank you for your business. &nbsp;We value serving your insurance needs. &nbsp;</b><br />
