Dear Group Administrator,
 
Effective May 1, 2015  your USAble Life invoice became available online through AccessAble.  To date, we have not received payment for your May 1 bill.  Your insurance policy with USAble Life provides valuable protection and was purchased to provide an important benefit for your employees.  We know how important this coverage is to you and your employees; therefore, we take several measures to help guard against lapses that may have been unintentional.  
 
At this time, your group insurance premiums are past due. The current amount due is ($).  We realize this may have been an oversight; therefore, as the group contact on file to receive notification of your bill being available online, we have reset your password and provided a link  below to access your bill.
